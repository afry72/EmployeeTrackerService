## Challenges

this project was not as much as a challenge as i thought it was going to be initially, but it still had its problems, for example using any version of inquirer other than 8.2.6, in my testing, completely bricks the application, another problem was linking joining and routing everything going on in the application, it became difficult to create unique identifiers for each var const and let, also there wasnt a lot of information on creating something similar to this application that i could find
